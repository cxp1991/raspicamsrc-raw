This is a GStreamer wrapper around the raspivid/raspistill
functionality of the RaspberryPi, providing a GStreamer
source element capturing from the Rpi camera.

To use it, you need GStreamer 1.0. On Raspbian, you can use
the packages being built by a volunteer by adding to your apt sources.list:
deb http://vontaene.de/raspbian-updates/ . main

Install the GStreamer 1.0 dev packages, then just build and install this module.

For example, again on Raspbian:

./autogen --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/
make
sudo make install

Then, you can try out the camera with a pipeline line:
gst-launch-1.0 rpicamsrc bitrate=1000000 ! filesink location=test.h264
should produce a file called test.h264, while showing a preview window
on the screen.

gst-inspect-1.0 rpicamsrc to get an idea of the properties that have been
implemented.
